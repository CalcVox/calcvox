## Building

We are using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) to manage and build this project. Just follow the instructions for installing it and it should build. The board we are using is an [ePulse Feather](https://thingpulse.com/product/epulse-feather-low-power-esp32-development-board/) ESP32 Development Board. We have multiple configurations of hardware in the list and schematics for those can be found [on our GitHub](https://github.com/CalcVox/calcvox-schematics).
